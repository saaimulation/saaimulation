# Hi, I’m Saaim 👋  

🚀 Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Leicester

🏎️ Aspiring Aerodynamicist at Formula 1!

🛠️ CAD, CFD, wind tunnels, and 3D printers (I break them more often than I should, but that’s part of the fun)  

---

## 🌍 About Me  
- Building personal projects in **aerodynamics and aero testing** (mini wind tunnels, CFD studies, F1-inspired aero parts).    
- Proud owner of a Bambu A1, after saying goodbye to the Ender 3 Pro. My house sounds like a factory at 3am.  
- Huge fan of learning by doing… and redoing… and occasionally duct taping.
- NOT Tony Stark, but I am slowly trying to get there :D

## 📂 Featured Projects  
🔹 [**Mini Wind Tunnel – Mark I**](https://github.com/saaimulation/Mini-wind-tunnel)  
First attempt at building a tunnel from cardboard, bottles, and a Pringles can. It worked… sort of. Smoke flow was chaotic, but so was the design. Learned more from this than any textbook.  

🔹 [**Project: Aero**](https://github.com/saaimulation/Project-Aero)  
Designing a 2026-regulated F1 front wing in Siemens NX, then testing it in SimScale CFD.  
Then 3D printing the wing at a smaller scale, and testing it in a new and improved wind tunnel!  
Basically me seeing if student laptops + duct tape can stand up against a £135m aero department.  

🔹 [**"UAV Is Online"**](https://github.com/saaimulation/UAV-Is-Online)  
Personal CFD log for the UoL AeroLabs team. Building a laptop friendly baseline in SimScale,   
then nudging geometry for small, repeatable gains. Rules PDF linked. No raw CAD here, just plots and notes.

🔹 [**FS26 Aerodynamics**](https://github.com/saaimulation/UoL-Racing-FS26-Aerodynamics)  
Repo that documents my work on the 2026 UoL Racing Aerodynamics team while protecting team IP. STAR CCM workflow, high level results, clean comparisons, and what I learned. No geometry, meshes, or solver decks.


🔹 **Codename: Blue Steel** (coming soon)

## 🎯 Currently working on...
- Running CFD analysis using SimScale, on the ST0
- Thinking of a plan to create Wind Tunnel Mark II
- Leading my aerodynamics team in the IMechE UAS challenge 
- Working on CFD for the new 2026 Formula Student car

## ⚡ Fun Facts  
- Built my first “wind tunnel” out of cardboard and a Pringles can. It *technically* worked.  
- I believe duct tape should be considered a legitimate engineering material.  
- Anime fight scenes lowkey inspire my aero concepts. Don’t ask why.
