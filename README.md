# Hi, I’m Saaim 👋  

-🚀 Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Leicester
-🏎️ Aspiring Aerodynamicist at Formula 1!
-🛠️ CAD, CFD, wind tunnels, and 3D printers (I break them more often than I should, but that’s part of the fun)  

---

## 🌍 About Me  
- Building personal projects in **aerodynamics and aero testing** (mini wind tunnels, CFD studies, F1-inspired aero parts).  
- Currently teaching myself **Python** so I can stop bullying Excel into doing things it wasn’t designed for.  
- Proud owner of a Bambu A1, after saying goodbye to the Ender 3 Pro. My house sounds like a factory at 3am.  
- Huge fan of learning by doing… and redoing… and occasionally duct taping.
- NOT Tony Stark, but I am slowly trying to get there :D

## 📂 Featured Projects  
🔹 [Mini Wind Tunnel – Mk I](https://github.com/saaimulation/Mini-wind-tunnel)  
First attempt at building a tunnel from cardboard, bottles, and a Pringles can. It worked… sort of. Smoke flow was chaotic, but so was the design. Learned more from this than any textbook.  

🔹 **F1 Wing Design & CFD** (coming soon)  
Simplified F1 wings, tested in CFD. Basically me trying to see if SolidWorks + patience can compete with a £200m aero department.  

🔹 **3D Printing Aero Parts** (coming soon)  
Because if it isn’t in plastic on my desk, does it even exist?  

---

## 🎯 Next Goals  
- Build **Wind Tunnel Mk II** (with actual flow straighteners this time).  
- Automate CFD post-processing with Python (so I can spend less time staring at progress bars).  
- Get a placement/internship in motorsport and put all of this to use.  
- Keep documenting projects here so future-me can laugh at current-me.

## ⚡ Fun Facts  
- Built my first “wind tunnel” out of cardboard and a Pringles can. It *technically* worked.  
- I believe duct tape should be considered a legitimate engineering material.  
- Anime fight scenes lowkey inspire my aero concepts. Don’t ask why.
